            <ol><h2>After Visa Issuance</h2></ol>
            <ol>Q . How do I read and understand my visa?</ol>
            <ol>A . If any of the information on

            <ol>Q . My visa expires in 5 years, what does this mean?</ol>
            <ol>A . A visa must be valid at the time a traveler seeks admission to the United States,
                but the expiration date of the visa (validity period/length of time the visa can be used) 
                has no relation to the length of time a temporary visitor may be authorized by the Department
                of Homeland Security to remain in the United States. </ol>

            <ol>Q . My old passport has already expired. My visa to travel to the United States is still valid but in my expired passport. 
                Do I need to apply for a new visa with my new passport? </ol>
            <ol>A .No. If your visa is still valid you can travel to the United States with your two passports, 
                as long as the visa is valid, not damaged, and is the appropriate type of visa required for your 
                principal purpose of travel. </ol><br/>
            <ol>Q . My visa will expire while I am in the United States. Is there a problem with that?</ol>

                -entry admitted you into the United States for a specific period of time, s/he will note your authorized period of 
                stay on your admission stamp or paper Form I-94, called an Arrival/Departure Record.</ol><br/>
            <ol>Q . What are indefinite validity visas (Burroughs visas) and are they still valid?</ol>
            <ol>A . Indefinite validity visas (Burroughs Visas) are tourist/business visas manually stamped into a travelerâ€™s passport
                which were valid for ten years. </ol>

            <ol>A . The fee that you paid is an application fee. Everyone who applies for a U.S. visa 
                anywhere in the world must pay this fee, which covers the cost of processing your application.
                This fee is non-refundable regardless of whether you are issued a visa or not, since your
                application was processed to conclusion.</ol><br/>
